# Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using a machine learning model. By analyzing various meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, the model aims to accurately forecast whether it will rain tomorrow. This predictive capability can be valuable for agricultural planning, disaster management, and daily weather forecasting.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the meteorological dataset to handle missing values and prepare the data for modeling.
- Explore the dataset to understand the relationships between different features and their impact on rainfall.
- Implement a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of rainfall based on the given features.
- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Data

The dataset includes various meteorological parameters, such as:

- **MinTemp**: Minimum temperature of the day
- **MaxTemp**: Maximum temperature of the day
- **Rainfall**: Total rainfall in mm
- **Evaporation**: Total evaporation in mm
- **Sunshine**: Total hours of sunshine
- **WindGustDir**: Direction of the strongest wind gust
- **WindGustSpeed**: Speed of the strongest wind gust
- **Humidity9am**: Humidity at 9 AM
- **Humidity3pm**: Humidity at 3 PM
- **Pressure9am**: Atmospheric pressure at 9 AM
- **Pressure3pm**: Atmospheric pressure at 3 PM
- **Cloud9am**: Cloud cover at 9 AM
- **Cloud3pm**: Cloud cover at 3 PM
- **RainToday**: Whether it rained today
- **RainTomorrow**: Target variable indicating whether it will rain tomorrow

The dataset comprises over 145,000 records and 23 features.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

- **Missingno** for visualizing missing data

## Model Building

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding feature distributions and relationships through visualizations.
3. **Model Training**: Using classification algorithms to predict rainfall, with an emphasis on handling imbalanced data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting rainfall, utilizing various meteorological features and machine learning techniques. The model developed can be applied to real-world weather forecasting scenarios, offering practical insights and predictions.
